        "Key to the concept of batch normalization is the doing gradient descent on batches of data. So we instead of using last week's stochastic gradient descent, we will first implement the *mini-batch* gradient descent method `mini_gd`, which is a hybrid between *stochastic* gradient descent and *batch* gradient descent. The lecture notes on <a href=\"https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/courseware/Week7/neural_networks_2/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B6.036%2B2019_Spring%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40neural_networks_2_optimizing_neural_network_parameters_vert\"> optimizing neural network parameters</a> are helpful for this part.\n",

        "\n",
        "* `X`: a standard data array (d by n)\n",
        "* `y`: a standard labels row vector (1 by n)\n",

As in our implementation of `sgd` from homework 7, we compute the predicted output for a mini-batch of data with the `Sequential.forward` method. We compute the loss between our predictions and the true labels using the assigned `Sequential.loss` method. (Note that in homework 7, `Sequential.step` was called `Sequential.sgd_step`. While the functionality of the step function is the same, it has been renamed for convenience. The same is true for the `module.step` function of each module we implemented, where applicable.)\n",

        "For picking $K$ unique data points at random from our large data-set for each mini-batch, we will implement the following strategy: we will first shuffle our data points `X` (and associated labels `y`). Then, we get <math>\\frac{n}{k}</math> (rounded down to the nearest integer) different mini-batches by grouping each $K$ consecutive points from this shuffled array. If we end up iterating over all the points but need more mini-batches, we will repeat the shuffling and the batching process."
